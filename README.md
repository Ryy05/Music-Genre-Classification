# Music Genre classification

A Music Genre Classifier is a sophisticated software tool designed to predict the genre of a piece of music based on its audio features. These classifiers are increasingly utilized in various applications, such as automatically tagging music tracks for distributors like Spotify and Billboard, and curating appropriate background music for different events.

Music genre classification is inherently challenging due to the subtle and often ambiguous distinctions between genres. This complexity makes machine learning particularly well-suited for the task, as it can discern and predict these nuanced patterns when provided with sufficient audio data. With the vast amount of freely available music online, it is possible to gather large datasets that machine learning algorithms can use to identify these complex patterns.

The goal of this project was to develop a proof-of-concept music genre classifier using a deep learning approach. The classifier is capable of predicting the genre of Western music across popular genres such as classical, jazz, rap, rock, and others, along with a confidence level for each prediction.

For this project, I implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, leveraging its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and its ability to handle the complexities of audio data. The SVM model was trained on a labeled dataset of music tracks, each tagged with its corresponding genre. Through this project, I've demonstrated the potential of machine learning in addressing the challenges of genre classification, paving the way for more sophisticated music tagging and recommendation systems.
